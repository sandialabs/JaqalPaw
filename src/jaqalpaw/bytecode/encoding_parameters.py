# LUT Address Widths
# These values contain the number of bits used for an address for a
# particular LUT. The address width is the same for reading and writing
# data for the Pulse LUT (PLUT) and the Sequence LUT (SLUT), but the
# address width is asymmetric for the Gate LUT (GLUT). This is because
# the read address is partly completed by external hardware inputs and
# the read address size (GLUTW) is thus smaller than the write address
# size (GPRGW) used to program the GLUT
GPRGW = 12  # Gate LUT write address width
GLUTW = 11  # Gate LUT read address width
SLUTW = 14  # Sequence LUT address width

# Ancilla readout extends the address space for readout from the GLUT.
# While the hardware supports a more free form approach to how one might
# choose to program the GLUT for ancilla readout purposes, combining
# normal gate sequences with ancilla readout sequences require distinguishing
# between the two cases. This is currently achieved by enforcing that the
# MSB of the physical GLUT address be set to one to mark the readout as
# pertaining to an ancilla. In this case an ancilla readout of all zeros
# will produce an output that is distinguished from the normal streaming case.
# The ANCILLA_STATE_LSB also sets the offset for ancilla readout bits
# which form the upper part of the GLUT address. This may change based on
# the number of supported hardware input lines for ancilla readout but sets
# the offset for a GLUT programming word for where the LSB of the hardware
# input register should start.
